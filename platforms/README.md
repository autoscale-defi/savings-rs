# The Platforms Smart Contracts

Those contracts are the ones that are between the controller and the DeFi platforms. They all have the same interface to be easily used by the controller by interacting with them in the same way.

## How to interact with a platform smart contract as a controller

- `deposit` endpoint. The controller call this endpoint with USDC as payment. The smart contract will deposit the USDC in the platform based one the strategy previously defined.
- `withdraw` endpoint. The controller call this endpoint with an amount of USDC to withdraw. The smart contract will withdraw the USDC from the platform and send them back to the controller.
- `claimRewards` endpoint. The controller call this endpoint to claim all the rewards generated by all the positions on the platform. The rewards are sent to the controller directly from this Smart Contract.
- `getDepositedAssets` view. The controller call this view to get the total amount of USDC deposited in the platform.
