# The Vault Smart Contract

It is the smart contract that stores the rewards generated by Savings+. It is also the smart contract that distributes the rewards to the users.

The [Controller](../controller/README.md) smart contract is the only one that can interact with the Vault smart contract.

## How to interact with the contract as a controller

- `increaseReserve` endpoint. The controller call this endpoint with USDC as payment. The USDC is stored in the Vault smart contract as a reserve.
- `sendRewards` endpoint. The controller call this endpoint by giving the amount and the destination of the rewards. The rewards are sent to the destination address directly from this Smart Contract.
